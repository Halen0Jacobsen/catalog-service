Project overview:

This project focuses on building a catalog-service application using Java files and using Spring Boot with Gradle to build and Kubernetes to deploy the application.

The first step is to create our Java files and build them using spring initializer and Gradle, for this project, I have chosen to use IntelliJ as my IDE. *Java and Gradle must be downloaded and installed locally. (I am using Java 17 and Gadle 8.3)
